SDL2 Framework

I compile this in Linux. I have the install script located in github.com/rcman/linuxapps

This sets up my Linux box the way I want. You can remove what you don't want. It installs all the SDL2 libraries and scons as well. All you need to do is go into the directory and run 'scons'

This initialized most stuff, brings in a couple bmp files and moves them on the screen. Nothing too exciting but it's nice and clean.

Please let me know if you have any issues.
